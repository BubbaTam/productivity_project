## Motivation
I am interested in increasing my daily productivity by understanding how I use my time. I also have implementations I would like to add to my daily processes; I would like to evaluate the impact of changes by having data before and after the change.

## Background

#### Customer
- A person who is interested in how they use their time
#### Goal
- A desire to align daily activities with goals (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
#### Pains
- Doing activities that aren't of value
- Dismissive awareness of their patterns
- Inadequate accountability for actions
- Insufficient emotional control
- Awareness of the short, medium and long-term consequences of actions 
#### Gains
- A central location to keep track of goals, expectations, constraints and a form of accountability for how the individual uses their time

| Assumption | Actual | Reason |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| That being aware of actions and reflecting on decisions made will help on progression toward personally set goals | | |
### Value Proposition
#### Product
- An application for users to store goals (professional, lifestyle, etc.) and aid with their goal execution (A personal task management application)
#### Alleviates
- Accountability to follow through with goals
#### Advantages
- A central location for personal goal setting and goal execution by helping the user keep accountability
#### Objectives
- To create a central location to keep track of goals, expectations, constraints and a form of accountability for how the individual uses their time
- Real-time updates on activities the user is doing to aid with accountability
- An interface to see general metrics and the progress of metrics related to goals and objectives
- For the user to input feedback on activities and goals
## Solution
### Features (to meet objectives)
- An interface to see a real-time update on data
- The ability to connect to applications that have metrics that measure metrics for specific goals
- Input for activities the user does not want to do
- Input for reflection
### Integration
- UI/UX for the interface
- Responsibility of the individual to track the data points
- Reflection periods (during the day and weekly)
### Alternatives
### Constraints
- I initially do not plan to put money into this
### Out-of-Scope
- Money tracking
- ML and text understanding
##### Decisions

## Build Status
Currently on on the iteration of creating the Data Pipelines from relevant data sources to a central database [ -- SSOT: Single Source of Truth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth).
