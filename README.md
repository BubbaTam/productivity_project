## Motivation
I am interested in increasing my daily productivity by understanding how I use my time. I also have implementations I would like to add to my daily processes; I would like to evaluate the impact of changes by having data before and after the change.

## Background (Customer-Centric Value Approach)

#### Customer
- A person who is interested in how they are using their time
#### Goal
- A desire to align daily activities with goals (daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, yearly)
- Accountability towards their goals and keeping to constraints
- Mindful of how the individual uses their resources (Time, attention, Energy, Focus, etc.) but to a level that does not require much input from the individual
- For the user to easily evaluate their progress
- Measure how well keeping up with beliefs (self-talk), character traits, skills
- If I am doing high valued tasks or not
- How well am I using my time
- A way to experiment with changes to their activities
#### Pains
- An application to keep an individual accountable toward goals and expectations
- Having real-time reminders on time usage
- A location to store and keep track of goals
- Awareness of themselves: patterns in an individuals lifestyle such as most productive periods in the day and triggers for bad habits, is their current activity aligned with goals
#### Gains
- A central location to keep track of goals, expectations, constraints and a form of accountability for how the individual uses their time

| That being aware of actions and reflecting on decisions made will help on progression toward personally set goals | | |
### Value Proposition
#### Product
#### Alleviates
#### Advantages
#### Objectives
- Release 1 == Is to focus on the Data engineering from multiple data sources
## Solution
### Features (to meet objectives)
-  An interface to see a real-time update on data
### Integration
- Responsibility of the individual to track the data points
- Reflection periods (during the day and weekly)
### Constraints
### Out-of-Scope
